## Custom Attribute Fields
Custom attribute field headings must have a format of ‘attr_{attribute handle}’. Example: attr_my_attribute.

Note: Custom attributes will not be created during import. If a custom attribute does not exist prior to import, the custom attribute data will not be added to that product.

## Product Groups
Product groups can be specified by name in a column named pProductGroups. Separate each group name with a comma.  If the product group does not exist, it will be created. This field is optional.

## Roadmap
* Use a queue to process data
* Add a summary and confirmation before import
* Add option to skip product updates
* Support image IDs in CSV data
* Dispatch concrete5 events
